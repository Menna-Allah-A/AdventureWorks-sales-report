## Problem Statement
Understanding sales performance is essential for driving business strategy and improving revenue. This dashboard visualizes detailed sales data, enabling users to analyze trends, compare salespersons, and identify high-performing products. The decomposition tree facilitates a comprehensive breakdown of sales data, enhancing user exploration and insight generation.

### Steps Followed

- Data Acquisition: Utilized SQL to collect sales data from the Adventure Works database, focusing on total sales, lifetime sales, and sales by region and product categories.

- Data Import: Imported and cleaned the dataset into Power BI to prepare for analysis.

- Dashboard Design:Created a primary table displaying salespersons, their total lifetime sales, and other relevant metrics.

- Developed a slicer for users to filter data by year, sales groups, and countries.

- Decomposition Tree Implementation: Integrated a decomposition tree to allow users to drill down into sales data by product categories and territories.

- Individual Salesperson Dashboards: Created detailed dashboards for each salesperson, showcasing year-over-year sales, top-selling products, and cumulative sales trends.

- Interactive Features: Enabled users to select a salesperson from the table to explore their specific sales data and performance metrics.

- Metadata Inclusion: Added contextual information about data sources, methodologies, and limitations to enhance transparency.

- Visual Enhancements: Utilized various visualizations, including bar charts and line graphs, to represent sales trends and comparisons 
effectively.

### Insights

- Sales Performance Overview: The main table provides a clear view of each salesperson's performance, with total lifetime sales highlighted for quick assessment.

- Dynamic Filtering: The slicer allows users to customize their view based on specific criteria, making the analysis more relevant and focused.
Decomposition Tree Utility: The decomposition tree enables users to explore sales data hierarchically, identifying key contributors to total sales across 
different categories and regions.

- Year-over-Year Analysis: Individual dashboards for salespersons reveal trends over time, helping to  assess performance and growth areas.
